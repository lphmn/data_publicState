As I am not the data steward, I will need to ensure that any updates or edits to the data are reflected here. I will do my best to keep this information current, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to maintain it consistently in the future.

**My wishlist is that MN data stewards begin storing their publicly available data in a friendlier manner.**

## Childhood Lead Exposure https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/lead
* Percentages flagged with an asterisk (*) should be interpreted with caution since they are based on less than 20 EBLLs and the percent elevated can change dramatically with the addition or subtraction of one EBLL.  
This query uses both a birth year and test year approach.  
Data for birth year (cohort method) determine how many children born in a specific year were tested before 3 years old and how many of those tested had an elevated blood lead level.  
Data for test year (annual method) determine how many children were tested in that year in the specific age group and how many of those tested had an elevated blood lead level.  
Lead testing is not universal in Minnesota.  
Children with risk factors for lead exposure (such as older housing or poverty status) are targeted for testing.  
Because lead testing is not universal the 'percent elevated' indicator cannot be generalized for the overall population of children living in Minnesota.  
There is no safe level of exposure to lead.  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now uses a reference level of 5 micrograms per deciliter (5 mcg/dL) to identify children with blood lead levels that are much higher than most children.

## Radon https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/radon  
Minnesota Public Health Data Access - Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)  
Radon (2010-2020)  
Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas that naturally comes from the soil. It can enter any building—homes, offices, and schools—and result in a high indoor Radon level. Radon gives off radioactive particles that, when breathed in, can damage the lining of the lungs. The U.S. Surgeon General has warned that Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States today. Radon accounts for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year and is a serious public health issue in Minnesota, where 2 in 5 of homes tested have Radon levels that are a major health risk.  
The testing assumes that users (primarily property owners) followed the instructions for test kit deployment. These data are not limited to homes, but the large majority of tests are likely from single family homes, and do not include tests conducted with continuous radon monitors by professionals, such as home inspectors. These tests exclude tests conducted for most real estate. These data may be incomplete due to inconsistent reporting from laboratories. The Minnesota Department of Health does not guarantee the geographic accuracy or completeness of mapped boundaries and features. Geographic boundaries on this map are subject to periodic updates (e.g., zip code boundaries and census tracts change over time) and may vary across sources.  
The Minnesota Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program receives the data from the Minnesota Department of Health Indoor Air Unit. The EPHT Program then calculates the measures.
