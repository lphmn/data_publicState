# Data was downloaded from MDH's Public Health Data Access Portal 
As I am not the data steward, I will need to ensure that any updates or edits to the data are reflected here. I will do my best to keep this information current, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to maintain it consistently in the future.

**My wishlist is that MN data stewards begin storing their publicly available data in a friendlier manner.**

## Health Insurance as of 10/01/2024 does not have county data to download https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/insurance

## Immunizations can be found at the [diseasesConditions repository](https://github.com/quincountychsmn/MN_PublicData/tree/main/MN_PHDAP/diseasesConditions)

## Obesity (wicObesity) https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/obesity  
This data set did not provide a data breakdown after downloading it but information about the data can be found [HERE](https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/WIC_metadata)

## Oral Health can be found at the [diseasesConditions repository](https://github.com/quincountychsmn/MN_PublicData/tree/main/MN_PHDAP/diseasesConditions)

## Poverty and Income https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/poverty  
**This data set can be pulled directly from the Census so it was not included in this repository**

##Smoking https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/smoking  
**This data set cannot be broken down by county so it was not included in this repository; check out the CDC Places Project to get projections by County**
