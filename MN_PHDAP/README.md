PHDAP stands for Public Health Data Access Portal.  
The Minnesota Department of Health is the primary data steward. For more information about the portal please visit https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/web/mndata/home.  

The reason for moving the data to this GitHub repository is the data cannot be easily pulled into a shinyLive R application (an application ran without a server).  

The strength for restoring the data in a friendly format does have a limitation. Since I am not the data steward, if/when data is updated/edited, I'd have to make sure the data is updated here.  
I will do my best to keep this up to date. However, I cannot guarentee I will be able to maintain it moving forward. My wishlist is all MN data stewards begin storing data in a friendly manner but understand this may not be possible.
