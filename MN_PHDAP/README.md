PHDAP stands for Public Health Data Access Portal.  
The Minnesota Department of Health is the primary data steward for the Minnsota Public Health Data Access Portal.  
For more information about the portal please visit https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/web/mndata/home. 

The reason for moving the data to this GitHub repository is the data cannot be easily pulled into a shinyLive R application (an application ran without a server).  

The strength for saving the data in a friendly format does have a limitation. As I am not the data steward, I will need to ensure that any updates or edits to the data are reflected here. I will do my best to keep this information current, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to maintain it consistently in the future.

**My wishlist is that MN data stewards begin storing their publicly available data in a friendlier manner.**
