# Data was downloaded from MDH's Public Health Data Access Portal 
As I am not the data steward, I will need to ensure that any updates or edits to the data are reflected here. I will do my best to keep this information current, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to maintain it consistently in the future.

**My wishlist is that MN data stewards begin storing their publicly available data in a friendlier manner.**

## Air Quality https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/air  
**The data for the Air Quality is not up to date compared to the charts shared on the Public Health Data Access Portal which is why there is no CSV regarding this data**
