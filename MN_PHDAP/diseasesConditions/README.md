PHDAP stands for Public Health Data Access Portal. The Minnesota Department of Health is the primary data steward. For more information about the portal please visit https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/web/mndata/home.  The reason for moving the data to this GitHub repository is the data cannot be easily pulled into a shinyLive R application (an application ran without a server). The strength for restoring the data in a friendly format does have a limitation. Since I am not the data steward, if/when data is updated/edited, I'd have to make sure the data is update to date for this second storage. I will do my best to keep this up to date as best as I can, I cannot guarentee I will be able to maintain it moving forward. My wishlist is the MN Data stewards begin storing data in a friendly manner. 

Asthma  
* To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
** Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.  
***Age-adjusted rates can only be calculated for "All ages combined".  
Hospitalizations data do not include data from federal and sovereign hospitals (e.g. Veteran's Administration; Indian Health Service) or data on Minnesota residents seen in facilities outside of Minnesota and North Dakota. For more information see About the Asthma Data: http://health.mn.gov/mndataasthma_metadata

Birth Defects  
Prevalence is per 10,000 live births, unless otherwise noted for certain conditions  
Data for 2012-2016 births only include Hennepin and Ramsey counties  
Region and state data are for 2013-2017 births and 2014-2018 births  
All races/ethnicities combined includes "Other" and "Unknown" values  
Total number of live births includes genders listed as "Unknown" and "Other"  
Data for Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Endocardial Cushion Defect) exclude inlet ventricular septal defect  
Data for Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection begin in 2013  
Data for Ventricular Septal Defect include Inlet Ventricular Septal Defect  
Data for Hypospadias and Congenital Posterior Urethral Valves include male and unknown gender cases only. Prevalence is calculated per 10,000 male live births  
Data for Limb Deficiencies (reduction defects) exclude other specified reduction defect of lower limb, transverse reduction defect of lower limb not otherwise specified, unspecified reduction defect of lower limb, and reduction defect of unspecified limb  
Data source: Minnesota Department of Health Birth Defects Monitoring and Analysis Program


Cancer  
* To protect an individual's privacy counts are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 1000 people (or 5000 people for a 5-year period). Counts may also be suppressed in specific situations (see About the Cancer Data).  
Counts may also be suppressed in certain situations. See "About the Cancer Data": http://health.mn.gov/mndatacancer_metadata  
Rates based on numerators less than 10 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution. If the column labeled Unstable has a value of TRUE then that row has an unstable rate.  
Rates for "All Ages" are age-adjusted to the standard 2000 U.S. population. Rates for an age group (e.g. 0-14 years) are specific to that age group.  
Cancer incidence data is collected by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System (MCSS). MCSS is an ongoing program at the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota's central cancer registry.

Carbon Monoxide  
* To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Note: This table includes only carbon monoxide poisoning events that are unintentional and non-fire related.  
** Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  
* To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
** Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

** Diabetes currently does not have data to use for reporting **
