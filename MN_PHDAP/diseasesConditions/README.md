## Asthma  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/asthma_query
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.  
Age-adjusted rates can only be calculated for "All ages combined".  
Hospitalizations data do not include data from federal and sovereign hospitals (e.g. Veteran's Administration; Indian Health Service) or data on Minnesota residents seen in facilities outside of Minnesota and North Dakota.

## Birth Defects  
Prevalence is per 10,000 live births, unless otherwise noted for certain conditions  
Data for 2012-2016 births only include Hennepin and Ramsey counties (**2012-2016 was not downloaded and saved here**)  
Region and state data are for 2013-2017 births and 2014-2018 births  
All races/ethnicities combined includes "Other" and "Unknown" values  
Total number of live births includes genders listed as "Unknown" and "Other"  
Data for Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Endocardial Cushion Defect) exclude inlet ventricular septal defect  
Data for Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection begin in 2013  
Data for Ventricular Septal Defect include Inlet Ventricular Septal Defect  
Data for Hypospadias and Congenital Posterior Urethral Valves include male and unknown gender cases only. Prevalence is calculated per 10,000 male live births  
Data for Limb Deficiencies (reduction defects) exclude other specified reduction defect of lower limb, transverse reduction defect of lower limb not otherwise specified, unspecified reduction defect of lower limb, and reduction defect of unspecified limb

## Cancer  
To protect an individual's privacy counts are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 1000 people (or 5000 people for a 5-year period). Counts may also be suppressed in specific situations (see About the Cancer Data).  
Counts may also be suppressed in certain situations. See "About the Cancer Data": http://health.mn.gov/mndatacancer_metadata  
Rates based on numerators less than 10 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution. If the column labeled Unstable has a value of TRUE then that row has an unstable rate.  
Rates for "All Ages" are age-adjusted to the standard 2000 U.S. population. Rates for an age group (e.g. 0-14 years) are specific to that age group.  
Cancer incidence data is collected by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System (MCSS). MCSS is an ongoing program at the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota's central cancer registry.

## Carbon Monoxide  
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Note: This table includes only carbon monoxide poisoning events that are unintentional and non-fire related.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

## Heart Attack  
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

## Heat Related Illness  
Heat-Related Illness Emergency Department (ED) Visits by County: All Ages, 2017-2021 Heat-Related Illness Hospitalizations by County: All Ages, 2012-2021
The results represented are Heat-Related Illness ED visit and Heat-Related Illness hospitalization counts and age-adjusted rates by county in Minnesota.
MDH does not warrant or assume any responsibility for the accuracy of data in this file.  Such data should be used with caution, and the user of this data assumes all responsibilities for any consequences from its use. Heat-related illness ED rates represent heat-related illness emergency department visits by county in Minnesota. Heat-related illness hospitalization rates represent heat-related illness hospitalizations by county in Minnesota. Hospitalization measures on MN Public Health Data Access include discharges of Minnesota residents from hospitals in the border states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa.

Immunizations
Childhood vaccines offer life-saving protection from many very serious diseases including:
whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, chickenpox (varicella), pneumococcal disease 
(including pneumonia), rotavirus, and hepatitis A.
Seven vaccine series includes: DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, MMR (measles, 
mumps, rubella), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and 
PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The seven vaccine series rate does not include rotavirus 
or hepatitis A.
The MIIC population used to calculate childhood immunization rates is all individuals ages 24-35 months in MIIC.

## Adolescent vaccines offer life-saving protection from many very serious diseases, including:
whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, tetanus, meningitis, and HPV.
Data source: Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC).
Three vaccine series includes: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine; meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine, and human papillomavirus (HPV) series completion.
Adolescents aged 16 years are recommended to receive a meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) booster dose and talk with their health care provider if they should get meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine.
The MIIC population used to calculate childhood immunization rates is all individuals ages 13 years and 19 years in MIIC.

## The School Immunization Law in Minnesota (https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/basics/kids.html#laws) requires all students enrolled in grades kindergarten through 12 to show they have received certain immunizations or an exemption.
Schools are required to report immunization data to MDH each year through the Annual Immunization Status Report (AISR).
Data source: Annual Immunization Status Report.
Required vaccines for Kindergarten include:
DTaP: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine
Polio
MMR: measles, mumps, rubella vaccine
Hep B: Hepatitis B
Varicella (chickenpox)
Partially vaccinated indicates that a child has received one or more doses but has not completed the vaccine series.
