# Data was downloaded from MDH's Public Health Data Access Portal 
As I am not the data steward, I will need to ensure that any updates or edits to the data are reflected here. I will do my best to keep this information current, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to maintain it consistently in the future.

**My wishlist is that MN data stewards begin storing their publicly available data in a friendlier manner.**

## Asthma  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/asthma_query
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.  
Age-adjusted rates can only be calculated for "All ages combined".  
Hospitalizations data do not include data from federal and sovereign hospitals (e.g. Veteran's Administration; Indian Health Service) or data on Minnesota residents seen in facilities outside of Minnesota and North Dakota.

## Birth Defects  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/birth
Prevalence is per 10,000 live births, unless otherwise noted for certain conditions  
Data for 2012-2016 births only include Hennepin and Ramsey counties (**2012-2016 was not downloaded and saved here**)  
Region and state data are for 2013-2017 births and 2014-2018 births  
All races/ethnicities combined includes "Other" and "Unknown" values  
Total number of live births includes genders listed as "Unknown" and "Other"  
Data for Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Endocardial Cushion Defect) exclude inlet ventricular septal defect  
Data for Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection begin in 2013  
Data for Ventricular Septal Defect include Inlet Ventricular Septal Defect  
Data for Hypospadias and Congenital Posterior Urethral Valves include male and unknown gender cases only. Prevalence is calculated per 10,000 male live births

## Cancer  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/cancer
To protect an individual's privacy counts are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 1000 people (or 5000 people for a 5-year period). Counts may also be suppressed in specific situations (see About the Cancer Data).  
Counts may also be suppressed in certain situations. See "About the Cancer Data": http://health.mn.gov/mndatacancer_metadata  
Rates based on numerators less than 10 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution. If the column labeled Unstable has a value of TRUE then that row has an unstable rate.  
Rates for "All Ages" are age-adjusted to the standard 2000 U.S. population. Rates for an age group (e.g. 0-14 years) are specific to that age group.  
Cancer incidence data is collected by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System (MCSS). MCSS is an ongoing program at the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota's central cancer registry.

To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.  
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.  
Note: This table includes only carbon monoxide poisoning events that are unintentional and non-fire related.  
Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.

## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/copd 
To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.

## Heat Related Illness  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/heat
Heat-Related Illness Emergency Department (ED) Visits by County: All Ages, 2017-2021 Heat-Related Illness Hospitalizations by County: All Ages, 2012-2021
The results represented are Heat-Related Illness ED visit and Heat-Related Illness hospitalization counts and age-adjusted rates by county in Minnesota.
MDH does not warrant or assume any responsibility for the accuracy of data in this file.  Such data should be used with caution, and the user of this data assumes all responsibilities for any consequences from its use. Heat-related illness ED rates represent heat-related illness emergency department visits by county in Minnesota. Heat-related illness hospitalization rates represent heat-related illness hospitalizations by county in Minnesota. Hospitalization measures on MN Public Health Data Access include discharges of Minnesota residents from hospitals in the border states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa.

## Immunizations  https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/immunization
Childhood vaccines offer life-saving protection from many very serious diseases including:
whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, chickenpox (varicella), pneumococcal disease 
(including pneumonia), rotavirus, and hepatitis A.
Seven vaccine series includes: DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, MMR (measles, 
mumps, rubella), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and 
PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The seven vaccine series rate does not include rotavirus 
or hepatitis A.
The MIIC population used to calculate childhood immunization rates is all individuals ages 24-35 months in MIIC.

## Adolescent vaccines offer life-saving protection from many very serious diseases, including:
whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, tetanus, meningitis, and HPV.
Data source: Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC).
Three vaccine series includes: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine; meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine, and human papillomavirus (HPV) series completion.
Adolescents aged 16 years are recommended to receive a meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) booster dose and talk with their health care provider if they should get meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine.
The MIIC population used to calculate childhood immunization rates is all individuals ages 13 years and 19 years in MIIC.

## Oral Health Dental Services Recipients
Source: Minnesota Department of Human Services. Minnesota Health Care Programs Dental Services Recipients by County of Residence and Age.
A dental service is any diagnostic; preventive; or treatment service provided by or under the supervision of a dentist.  The data represents dental service use among all Minnesota Health Care Program (i.e.: Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare) recipients ages up to 100 years during the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) as determined by dental claims submitted by a licensed DHS provider.  Data in years 2012 through 2013 represent paid dental claims only; while calendar years 2014 and beyond represent paid; unpaid; or denied dental claims.
**Indicates data suppression due to small numbers (5 or less).
