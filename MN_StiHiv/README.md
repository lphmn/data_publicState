As of 10/04/2024, this data set is being revieved by MDH data stewards to store the data as a CSV. 

# Chlamydia and Gonorrhea data can be found [here](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/stds/stats/index.html)

# Syphilis data can be found [here](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/stds/stats/county.html)

# HIV data can be found [here](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/hiv/stats/index.html)

I do have this converted to a csv file but I am just waiting to make sure it is okay with MDH to share this as a csv.
