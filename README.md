# Public Data Sets Repository

This repository contains various public datasets related to Minnesota's public health and economic data.
**For the link to open in a new tab please perform the following CTRL+click (on Windows and Linux) or CMD+click (on MacOS)**
* Just like everything on the internet, links can eventually become outdated or broken.
* My hope is that state departments in Minnesota will start storing data in a way that allows programs like R and Python to access the data directly.
